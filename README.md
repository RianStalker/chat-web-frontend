This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

# What you'll need for the first part.

In the project directory, you'll need: <br />
1 react for the code `create-react-app .` <br />
2 yarn (doesn't everyone want instant?) for the code `yarn` <br />
3 the package for the code `yarn add`: <br />
`query-string` <br />
`react-emoji` <br />
`react-router` <br />
`react-router-dom` <br />
`react-scroll-to-bottom` <br />
`socket.io-client` <br />
4 delete inside `src` because we make from scratch in it. <br />
5 add folder `components` and `icons` in it. <br />
optional: add `LICENSE`

## Let's get started.

inside the components add folder and file in it: <br/>
Chat with js and css, <br/>
InfoBar, etc <br/>
Input, etc <br/>
Join, etc <br/>
TextContainer, etc <br/>
and for the Messages also add Message in it. <br />
add file `App.js` and `index.js`

## Time to get our hands dirty.

First for the icons add the png as like mine <br/>
Second for the css add it as like mine <br/>
Third for the index.js import `react`, `react-dom` and `App` <br/>
Fourth for the App.js import `Chat`, `Join` and (`BrowserRouter as Router, Route`) from `react-router-dom` <br/>
Fifth on App.js for the `const` add `Router` in it add route path for Chat and Join <br/>

## Houston we got problem.
